# Why Random Forest Outperforms Single Decision Trees: An Intuitive Visual Exploration ðŸ“Š

I built a Python animation to show how ensemble learning makes all the difference.

## What You'll Observe

- **Robust vs. Crisp Decision Boundaries:**  
  The random forest uses an ensemble technique to smooth out the noise, while the decision tree displays a jagged, overfitted boundary.

- **Better Generalization:**  
  Watch as the random forest's decision boundary gradually refines with the addition of more treesâ€”lowering variance and improving prediction accuracy.

- **Interactive Visuals:**  
  Enjoy dynamic, side-by-side visualizations that bring these concepts to life, illustrating how classification performance evolves over time.

## Note

While decision trees are easy to interpret, they often overfit and can be unstable with slight data variations. Random forests mitigate these issues by averaging the predictions of multiple trees, resulting in a more robust and accurate model.
